# This is my work in progress website based on D&D

Still learning and trying to get used to all the plain CSS. The page doesnt have any attractive atm because i spent most of the time getting the API to work fine.

## D&D API

The main focus of this project is to learn to call RESTful APIs on react where I'm a very new newbie. Planning on using the d&d api and see how it goes. https://www.dnd5eapi.co/
